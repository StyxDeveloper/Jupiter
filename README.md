# What Does Jupiter Do?
Jupiter was formerly a product made and designed by two individuals with our users at the core. However as times change so do what we as developers and people want. This little project will no longer be supported. Any quistions, comments, and or concerns about this product can be asked either via GitHub or Discord (styxdev). 

# Am I Allowed To Make A Pull Request?
No as of now Jupiter will not be accepting any of the pull requests, we will not stop you from creating a fork though. You are more than allowed (check our license). 


# How Do I Use The Script
Copy and paste our script source into your executor. This however is not recommended, this script is not fully supported anymore and will not be checked. I also do not know if it even works.
